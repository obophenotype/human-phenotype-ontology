## Patient Health Information Disclaimer

The HPO project offers a number of demonstration tools on the internet that intend to show prospective users how to run the tools and interpret the output. We note that in no case should Protected Health Information be transmitted to these tools across the internet. Instead, downloadable versions of these tools (such as the Exomiser) should be used behind appropriate firewalls.
