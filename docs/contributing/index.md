# HPO Workshops

Contributing
------------

We welcome the participation of interested colleagues. We have been collaborating with many clinicians and translational researchers to refine and extend the HPO resources since 2009, and anticipate continuing this process for the foreseeable future. Groups or persons with expert knowledge in a particular domain of human phenotyping in a medical genetics setting are invited to contribute their knowledge on a collaborative basis. We are indebted to all those who have made contributions of new terms, annotations, and other improvements. See the [Community page](https://hpo.jax.org/app/community){:target="_blank"} for more information.

There are many ways of contributing to the HPO project. One of the most important consists of community workshops, in which experts in a certain medical domain come together to review, revise, and extend specific areas of the HPO such as ophthalmology, mental disease, or immunology.
