# The distinction between diseases and phenotypes


The community uses the word _phenotype_ with multiple meanings. The HPO defines a disease as an entity that has all four of the following features:

*   an etiology (whether identified or as yet unknown)
*   a time course
*   a set of phenotypic features
*   if treatments exist, there is a characteristic response to them

A phenotype (better: _phenotypic feature_) is a component of a disease. HPO terms can be used to describe the set of phenotypic features that characterize a disease. For instance, if the disease is the common cold, then the phenotypes would be runny nose, fever, cough, fatigue, etc. Therefore, in the following description:

    a sepsis-like condition with intestinal pseudoobstruction, transient hypoglycemia,
    cholestatic hepatitis, and transient renal failure (maximum plasma creatinine
    132 μmol/L and urea 11 mmol/L at day 5 of life, which normalized on day 10).
  

We would conceptualize the "sepsis-like condition" as a disease, and would use HPO terms to describe

*   Intestinal pseudo-obstruction
*   Hypoglycemia with the modifier Transient.
*   Cholestatic liver disease.
*   Elevated serum creatinine.
*   Increased blood urea nitrogen.

Thus, the HPO considers a disease to be an entity that has a known or unknown cause, is characterized by one or more phenotypic features which can affect all or only a subset of individuals with the disease, a time course over which the phenotypic features may have onset and evolve, and in some cases one or more indicated treatments and a response to treatment. For instance, if the disease entity is the common cold, then the cause is a virus, the phenotypic features include fever, cough, runny nose, and fatigue, the time course usually is a relatively acute onset with manifestations dragging on for days to about a week, and the treatment may include bed rest, aspirin, or nasal sprays. In contrast, a phenotypic feature such as fever is a manifestation of many diseases. There is a grey zone between diseases and phenotypic features. For instance, diabetes mellitus can be conceptualized as a disease, but it is also a feature of other diseases such as Bardet Biedl syndrome. The HPO takes a practical stance and provides terms for such entities.
