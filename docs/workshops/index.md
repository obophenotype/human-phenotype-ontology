# HPO Workshops


The HPO has been a community project since its inception in 2008. We are indebted to all those who have made contributions of new terms, annotations, and other improvements. See the [Community page](https://hpo.jax.org/app/community){:target="_blank"} for more information.

There are many ways of contributing to the HPO project. One of the most important consists of community workshops, in which experts in a certain medical domain come together to review, revise, and extend specific areas of the HPO such as ophthalmology, mental disease, or immunology.
