# Software libraries for Working with the HPO

Below is a collection of software libraries that make it easy to work with the
Human Phenotype Ontology across different programming languages.

## Python

???+ abstract "Python Libraries"
    **hpo-toolkit**  
    [:material-language-python: GitHub](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/hpo-toolkit){ target="_blank" }

    A Python toolkit for working with HPO and HPO disease annotations.  
    Lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate into analysis workflows.

    **Ontology Access Kit (OAK)**  
    [:octicons-link-external-16: GitHub](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-access-kit){ target="_blank" }

    A powerful library for accessing and manipulating ontologies using multiple
    backends (SQLite, pronto, OBOGraph, APIs, etc.). Supports querying,
    transformation, and validation.

## Rust
???+ abstract "Rust libraries"
    **ontolius**
    [:material-language-rust: crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ontolius){ target="_blank" }

    A fast and safe crate for working with biomedical ontologies including HPO.

## Java

???+ abstract "Java Libraries"
    **phenol**  
    [:material-language-java: GitHub](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/phenol){ target="_blank" }

    A high-performance Java library for working with JSON-based phenotype
    ontologies including the HPO and Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP).
    Includes tools for parsing, annotation handling, and ontology traversal.

## R

???+ abstract "R Libraries"
    **HPOExplorer**  
    [:material-language-r: GitHub](https://github.com/neurogenomics/HPOExplorer){ target="_blank" }

    A feature-rich R toolkit for visualizing and analyzing the HPO. Includes
    interactive phenotype networks, semantic similarity, and annotation
    utilities.
