# SAMS (Symptom Annotation Made Simple)

 SAMS provides both intuitive ontology browsing and search functions as well as a number of features intended to support translational research. SAMS supports the Phenopacket standard for data exchange.

SAMS offers four main modes:

- Creation of a Phenopacket on the fly.
- Use as a database to store and retrieve patients’ phenotypes.
- Self-phenotyping of patients or their relatives and sharing their data with their doctors.
- Integration into other applications.
