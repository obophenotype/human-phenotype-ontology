It provides a structured representation of abnormal characteristics associated with diseases. HPO helps researchers and clinicians share and integrate phenotypic data, making understanding and diagnosing genetic disorders easier. It uses a hierarchical organization and semantic relationships between terms and allows for annotation of genes and diseases. HPO is used in multiple diagnosis and variant prioritization tools, aiding healthcare professionals and researchers in identifying and classifying genetic conditions. In 2023, HPO released an international edition which covers different languages such as Chinese, Turkish, Japanese, Spanish and Czech (more). The translations are displayed in the various browsers (e.g. HPO App and OLS).</p> <p>This site contains documentation for clinicians, researchers, developers, and other users of the HPO.</p> <p>   A snapshot of the HPO hierarchy (left) and the HPO App (right). </p> <p>To learn more, explore the HPO app.</p>"},{"location":"annotations/creation/","title":"How does the HPO project create the annotations?","text":"<p>The HPO project is indebted to OMIM at the very beginning of our project, we used text-mining to derive the first set of annotations for each disease from the Clinical Synopsis section of the corresponding OMIM entry (See PMID:18950739).

We request that all proposed changes be suggested on our GitHub tracker  so that they will be of use to all users of the HPO.</p> What is the medical focus of the Human Phenotype Ontology? <p>The medical focus of the HPO in its initial decade (2007-2017) was on rare, mainly Mendelian diseases. The construction of the initial version of the HPO in 2007/2008 was performed by generating an ontology based on descriptions in the Clinical Synopsis of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. Since the initial publication of the HPO in 2008, the HPO team has held regular workshops with clinicians to refine and extend the clinical terminology of the HPO in specific areas such as cardiology or immunology. We have added textual definitions, computational logical definitions, and many thousands of new terms since then. The  HPO is currently being extended to other areas of medicine.</p> What is an ontology? <p>A terminology contains a list of items (often called \"terms\") that represent the concepts of a domain. An ontology is a terminology that additionally specifies formal semantic relationships of concepts. For instance, a terminology of wines would include a list of items such as Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Rioja, Riesling, Sauvignon blanc, etc., but an ontology of wine might have a term for \"red wine\" and \"Rioja\"; It also can specify that \"Rioja\" is a type of \"red wine\". Ontologies and terminologies can be used as tools for standardizing and exchanging data. Ontologies such as the HPO typically enable sophisticated computational algorithms that exploit the semantic relations between terms.</p> How are the ontology terms structured? <p>Most ontologies are structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAG), which are similar to hierarchies but differ in that a more specialized term (child) can be related to more than one less specialized term (parent). Cycles (cyclic paths in the graph) are not allowed. The relationship of the terms of the HPO to one another is displayed in the DAG. For instance, the term Aplasia/Hypoplasia of metatarsal bones is a child of both Aplasia/Hypoplasia involving bones of the feet and Abnormal metatarsal morphology. The ability to encode multiple parents in a DAG adds to the flexibility and descriptiveness of the ontology. This would not be possible with a simple hierarchical system. The is-a relationship is transitive, meaning that annotations are inherited up all paths to the root. For instance, Abnormal morphology of the left ventricle is-a Abnormal cardiac ventricle morphology.</p> <p>Each term in the HPO describes a clinical abnormality. These may be general terms, such as Abnormal ear morphology or very specific ones such as Chorioretinal atrophy. The terms have a unique ID such as HP:0001140 and a label such as Epibulbar dermoid. Most terms have textual definitions such as An epibulbar dermoid is a benign tumor typically found at the junction of the cornea and sclera (limbal epibullar dermoid). The source of the definition must be indicated. Many terms have synonyms. For instance, Epibulbar dermoids is taken to be a synonym of Epibulbar dermoids.</p> How to collaborate with HPO? <p>We welcome the participation of interested colleagues. We anticipate that the structure of the HPO will continue to be refined and completed for some time to come. Groups or persons with expert knowledge in a particular domain of human phenotyping in a medical genetics setting are invited to contribute their knowledge on a collaborative basis.</p> <p>Issue Tracker</p> How to contribute translations? <p>The HPO Internationalization effort is a project coordinated by the HPO team and hosted on Github. Please see the translation documentation on how to collaborate. HPO Internationalization</p> How do I use HPO Annotations? <p>The terms of the HPO describe phenotypic abnormalities and do not directly describe diseases. Instead, the HPO project uses so-called annotations to describe the connection between diseases and HPO terms. For instance, the disease, Cutis laxa-Marfanoid syndrome is annotated by the HPO terms for Hip dislocation, Flexion contracture and many more.</p> <p>Annotation Documentation Page</p>"},{"location":"clinicians/HPO_term_selection/","title":"How to choose HPO terms for data entry?","text":"<p>Please see K\u00f6hler S, et al.

We recommend that users enter HPO terms for all \"major\" phenotypic abnormalities, perhaps 5-7 in the first round. In some cases it may be advisable to enter higher level terms; for instance, in some forms of skeletal dysplasia, affected individuals may have several abnormalities of all or most phalanges. Although very specific HPO terms exist for these (e.g., Bullet-shaped middle phalanx of the 5th toe and so on for the other toes), it may be preferable to enter Bullet-shaped toe phalanx if many phalanges of the toes are affected.

In biology, the most widely accepted definition of phenotype is the observable traits of an organism. In medical contexts, however, the word phenotype is more often used to refer to some deviation from normal morphology, physiology, or behavior. Many phenotypic descriptions in medical publications describe the phenotype in imprecise ways. For instance, a description such as myopathic electromyography is used instead of describing the reasons for this diagnosis, which can include reduced duration and reduced amplitude of the action potentials, increased spontaneous activity with fibrillations, positive sharp waves, or a reduced number of motor units in the muscle. In contrast, deep phenotyping is defined as the precise and comprehensive analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in which the individual components of the phenotype are observed and described (See Deep Phenotyping for Precision Medicine).

Components are often not needed for ontologies, but there are some use cases: <ol> <li>There is an automated process that generates and re-generates a part of the ontology</li> <li>A part of the ontology is managed in ROBOT templates</li> <li>The expressivity of the component is higher than the format of the edit file.

Note that doing this is a widespread antipattern (see related issue). You should not change the axioms of terms that do not belong into your ontology unless necessary - such changes should always be pushed into the ontology where they belong.

The idea is to only import axioms from ontologies that actually belong to it.  A base file is a subset of the ontology that only contains those axioms that nominally  belong there. In other words, the base file does not contain any axioms that belong to another ontology. An example would be this:</p> <p>Imagine this being the full Uberon ontology:</p> <pre><code>Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124\nAxiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123\nAxiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123\n</code></pre> <p>The base file is the set of all axioms that are about UBERON terms:</p> <pre><code>Axiom 1: UBERON:123 SubClassOf BFO:123\nAxiom 1: UBERON:124 SubClassOf UBERON 123\n</code></pre> <p>I.e.</p> <pre><code>Axiom 1: BFO:123 SubClassOf BFO:124\n</code></pre> <p>Gets removed.</p> <p>The base file pipeline is a bit more complex than the normal pipelines, because of the logical interactions between the imported ontologies.

When we use the base pipelines, we</p> <p>1) First obtain the base (usually by simply downloading it, but there is also an option now to create it with ROBOT) 2) We merge all base files into one big pile 3) Then we extract a single module <code>imports/merged_import.owl</code></p> <p>The first implementation of this pipeline is PATO, see https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/blob/master/src/ontology/pato-odk.yaml.</p> <p>To check if your ontology uses this method, check src/ontology/hp-odk.yaml to see if <code>use_base_merging: TRUE</code> is declared under <code>import_group</code></p> <p>If your ontology uses Base Module approach, please use the following steps: </p> <p>First, add the term to be imported to the term file associated with it (see above \"Using term files\" section if this is not clear to you)</p> <p>Next, you navigate in your terminal to the ontology directory (underneath src in your hpo root directory).  <pre><code>cd src/ontology\n</code></pre></p> <p>Then refresh imports by running</p> <p><pre><code>sh run.sh make imports/merged_import.owl\n</code></pre> Note: if your mirrors are updated, you can run <code>sh run.sh make no-mirror-refresh-merged</code></p> <p>This requires quite a bit of memory on your local machine, so if you encounter an error, it might be a lack of memory on your computer.
