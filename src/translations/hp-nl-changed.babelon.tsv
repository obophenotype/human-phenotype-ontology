en	The term Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) was initially used for patients diagnosed with fasting hyperglycemia that could be treated without insulin for more than two years, where the initial diagnosis was made at a young age (under 25 years). Thus, MODY combines characteristics of type 1 diabetes (young age at diagnosis) and type 2 diabetes (less insulin dependence than type 1 diabetes). The term MODY is now most often used to refer to a group of monogenic diseases with these characteristics. Here, the term is used to describe hyperglycemia diagnosed at a young age with no or minor insulin dependency, no evidence of insulin resistence, and lack of evidence of autoimmune destruction of the beta cells	HP:0004904	IAO:0000115	nl	The term Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) was initially used for patients diagnosed with fasting hyperglycemia that could be treated without insulin for more than two years, where the initial diagnosis was made at a young age (under 25 years).

SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins that regulate surfactant metabolism and have immunologic functions, whereas SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic molecules, which play a direct role in the organization of the surfactant structure in the interphase and in the stabilization of the lipid layers during the respiratory cycle.

en	The cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is an important fetal midline forebrain landmark that is normally visible by prenatal sonography. This term refers to the lack of visiblity of the CSP on prenatal sonography. The CSP normally can be visualized between 18 and 37 weeks of gestation. Lack of visualization of the CSP in this time period generally requires follow up and may indicate the presence of underlying malformations such as malformations of the corpus callosum. The lack of CSP before 18 weeks or after 37 weeks of gestation (or postnatally) is considered a normal finding	HP:4000138	IAO:0000115	nl	The cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is an important fetal midline forebrain landmark that is normally visible by prenatal sonography.
