Mature collagen VII undergoes a multistep fibril polymerization process to form the anchoring fibrils. Mutant pro-alpha1(VII) polypeptide chains or procollagen VII molecules do not pass the ER quality control and are retained in the ER or designated for ubiquitin-proteasome degradation resulting in reduced amounts of collagen VII in the skin.

en	Any anomaly of brain-evoked potentials, defined as potentials generated by exteroceptive stimuli reflect synchronized activity by neuronal and axonal groups in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from the arrival of nerve impulses after stimulation of a peripheral nerve or its receptors. Depending on the type of stimulus, evoked potentials are categorized as visual (VEP), auditory (AEP), or somatosensory (SSEP). Motor evoked potentials (MEP) occur when the brain's motor area is stimulated. They result from the activation of a sufficient number of motor units.	HP:0430106	IAO:0000115	cs		NOT_TRANSLATED

Comment: Sperm are produced within the testis, in the process of spermatogenesis, then travel through the male reproductive tract (the seminiferous tubules, epididymis, vas deferens, prostate and urethra). As the sperm travel, seminal fluid is added from the seminal vesicles, prostate, testis and epididymis and periurethral glands. The function of the ejaculate is to transport sperm into the female genital tract and to provide a suitable environment for sperm survival during this transit.

Brain contusions are bruises of the cortical surface that damage the surface from the outside inward, producing disruption of tissue and vessels.

Such lesions are usually found in coup and contrecoup, as well as inferior orbital, frontal, and temporal locations. Cerebral contusions cause permanent damage to tissues of the cerebrum.

A single second sound, however, is usually due to inability to auscultate a relatively soft pulmonic component.

In a minority of patients, a wide and often notched R wave pattern may be seen in leads V1 and/or V2; (iii) S wave of greater duration than R wave or greater than 40 ms in leads I and V6 in adults; and (iv) Normal R peak time in leads V5 and V6 but greater than 50 ms in lead V1.

In all cases, the central opacification is surrounded by additional, secondary opacifications arranged in ray-like structures around it.

en	A fenestration affecting the basilar artery. Basilar fenestration typically occurs at the lower end of the basilar artery just as the vertebral arteries join Fenestrations of intracranial arteries are segmental duplications of the lumen into two distinct endothelium-lined channels, which may or may not share their adventitial layer. They can range from a small focus of divided tissue to long-segment duplication. Fenestrations are the result of partial failure of fusion of paired primitive embryologic vessels or incomplete obliteration of different anastomosis in a primitive vascular network. The association of fenestrations with aneurysms has been suggested in many small case series, though the exact relationship is not well defined.	HP:6000787	IAO:0000115	cs		NOT_TRANSLATED

en	Partial or complete breakage (rupture) of the tibialis anterior tendon (TAT). The TAT is the principal dorsiflexor of the ankle joint and secondary invertor of the foot. It has important roles in the different stages of gait; in the swing phase, it concentrically dorsiflex the ankle for foot clearance and during plantarflexion of the ankle in the stance phase, it eccentrically contract to stabilize the ankle and prevent damage to the foot and ankle. Clinically, presentations in acute lacerations or direct trauma cases are straight forward, in chronic and atraumatic cases usually the symptoms at the time of TAT rupture are more subtle. Other manifestations include mild pain, localized mass, palpable gap, loss of strength, instability during gait, gait disturbances with forefoot dropping and stumbling and high stepping gait.
