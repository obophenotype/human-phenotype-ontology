comment: By embryo we mean in the sense of up to the 8th week postfertilization (over 7 and under 8 weeks), we treat fetus as a separate stage.

comment: Prenatal development is a continuum, with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. The use of the term "fetus" generally implies that a mammalian embryo has developed to the point of being recognizable as belonging to its own species, though the point at which this occurs is subjective.
