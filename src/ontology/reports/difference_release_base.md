The 1st arc (red) outlines the proximal surfaces and the 2nd arc (yellow) the distal surfaces of the scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum. The 3rd arc (white) outlines the proximal surfaces of the capitate and hamate. Disruption of carpal arcs (i.e., the arcs appear broken or discontinuous on radiographs) indicates a fracture or ligamentous injury in the wrist. |

| Primum atrial septal defect (HP:0010445) | An ostium primum atrial septal defect is located in the most anterior and inferior aspect of the atrial septum. The ostium primum refers to an anterior and inferior opening (ostium) within the septum primum, which divides the rudimentary atrium during fetal development. The ostium primum is normally sealed by fusion of the superior and inferior endocardial cushions around 5 weeks' gestation. Ostium primum defects result from a failure of the fusion of the embryologic endocardial cushion and septum primum. |                  An ostium primum atrial septal defect is located in the most anterior and inferior aspect of the atrial septum. The ostium primum refers to an anterior and inferior opening (ostium) within the septum primum, which divides the rudimentary atrium during fetal development.

Ostium primum defects result from a failure of the fusion of the embryologic endocardial cushion and septum primum. |
| Levotransposition of the great arteries (HP:0011540) | The essence of the lesion is the combination of discordant atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial connections. Thus, the morphologically right atrium is connected to a morphologically left ventricle across the mitral valve, with the left ventricle then connected to the pulmonary trunk. The morphologically left atrium is connected to the morphologically right ventricle across the tricuspid valve, with the morphologically right ventricle connected to the aorta. |                  Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) is a discordance of atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial connections. The anatomy of ccTGA involves systemic venous drainage to the morphologic right atrium (mRA), which is connected via the mitral valve to the morphologic left ventricle (mLV) whose outflow is the pulmonary arterial system. The pulmonary venous drainage arrives at the morphologic left atrium (mLA), which crosses the tricuspid valve into the morphologic right ventricle (mRV) with outflow into the systemic arterial system. In isolation, ccTGA has an in-series circulation without mixing; therefore, the presence or absence of associated defects dictates the patient's clinical presentation. |

| Coronary sinus atrial septal defect (HP:0011643) | An atrial septal defect characterized by a deficiency in the tissue separating the coronary sinus from the left atrium (LA). This results in partial or complete unroofing of the coronary sinus leading to a predominantly left-to-right shunt through the coronary sinus (LA to coronary sinus to right atrium [RA]). The orifice of the ostium is frequently large because of the increased flow. From the RA side, the defect is located at the level of the coronary sinus ostium and may also include some deficiency in atrial tissue around the ostium.

The orifice of the ostium is frequently large because of the increased flow. From the RA side, the defect is located at the level of the coronary sinus ostium and may also include some deficiency in atrial tissue around the ostium. From the LA side, the size can be variable depending on the degree of unroofing of the coronary sinus. There is partial (either focal or fenestrated) or complete absence of the roof of the CS, which results in a communication between the CS and the LA.

| obsolete Coronary sinus atrial septal defect (HP:0031297) | Unroofed coronary sinus (CS) is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly in which there is partial (either focal or fenestrated) or complete absence of the roof of the CS, which results in a communication between the CS and the LA. Unroofed CS is the rarest type of atrial septal defect.
