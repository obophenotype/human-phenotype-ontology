| Metatarsal head osteochondrosis (HP:6001347) | Avascular necrosis of a metatarsal head, most commonly involving the second, but also the third or fourth, metatarsal.\nComment: Affected individuals may present with foot pain on weight-bearing, swelling, and tenderness. Radiological features include widening of the metatarsophalangeal joint space and flattening of the affected metatarsal head, at later stages metatarsal head sclerosis, cortical thickening, and intra-articular loose bodies. Osteochondrosis is a condition resulting from an epiphysis injury that alters enchondral ossification and produces irregularity at the joint surface. Freiberg disease is characterized as osteochondrosis of the metatarsal heads (primarily the second). |
| Hallux sesamoiditis (HP:6001348) | Inflammation of the sesamoid bones of the hallux ( two ovoid-shaped ossicles embedded within the tendons under the big toe). This feature can be ascertained by MRI of the foot, revealing edema within one or both of the hallux sesamoids. |
| Acromioclavicular joint separation (HP:6001338) | An acromioclavicular (AC) joint joint separation, often called a shoulder separation, is a dislocation of the clavicle from the acromion. This feature is ascertainable radiographically by AC joint x-ray views including bilateral anteroposterior (AP) view, axillary lateral view, and/or Zanca view showing either superior, posterior, or inferior displacement of the distal clavicle in relation to the acromion at the AC joint. |
| Proximal humeral epiphysiolysis (HP:6001341) | Proximal humeral epiphysiolysis (Little League shoulder) is a shear or stress injury of the epiphyseal cartilage of the proximal humerus.

| Abnormal CSF guanidinoacetic acid concentration (HP:0020004) | The concentration of guanidinoacetic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is outside the limits of normal. |
| Embryo developmental arrest (HP:0020003) | A failure of an embryo to progress through the early stages of preimplantation development (typically from fertilization, i.e., 1-cell zygote, to blastocyst on day 5-6), and is used clinically when embryos fail to reach transferable stages in assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) such in vitro fertilization (IVF). Arrested embryo development is characterized by downregulation of metabolic activity and cessation of cell division. In order for an embryo to be characterized as non-viable, i.e., arrested, it should present with a lack of cleaving activity and fail to show a sign of mitotic cellular division for at least 24 hours. One can observe failure of a zygote to cleave, cleavage stage arrest either on day 2 or day 3 when the embryo is expected to be between the 2 and 8-cell stage, failure to compact to morula, or failure to form a blastocyst. |
| Abnormal affect regulation (HP:0020007) | A disturbance in the processes by which emotional responses are initiated, modulated, sustained, or terminated in a contextually appropriate manner. Abnormal affect regulation involves maladaptive patterns in the generation, intensity, or control of affective experience and expression, leading to inconsistent, excessive, or insufficient modulation of emotion relative to situational demands. |
| Metaphase II oocyte maturation arrest (HP:6001355) | The morphologic classification of MII generally denotes an oocyte that is mature, having arrested in metaphase II and is presumed to be capable of fertilization. However, there are subsets of women who produce oocytes with MII morphology that are not capable of embryo formation even with fertilization. This incongruence between morphologic maturity and capacity could be attributed to either the inclusion within the morphologic classification immature oocytes arrested at any stage between PBI formation and metaphase II, which are not capable of fertilization, or oocytes arrested normally at metaphase II that do not possess the ability to complete meiosis. |
| Dorsal forearm pain (HP:6001357) | Pain localized to dorsal (non-palmar) aspect of the forearm. |
| Fifth metatarsal apophysitis (HP:6001344) | Iselin's disease is a traction apophysitis of base of fifth metatarsal. The apophysis is within the peroneus brevis tendon insertion site and appears radiographically at about age 10 in female and age 12 in male and usually fuses by age 11 in female and by age 14 in male. Repetitive microtrauma from the peroneus brevis tendon, as occurs in sports activities is the cause of traction apophysitis. It can be ascertained by oblique foot radiographs showing apophyseal irregularity (enlarged apophysis, disordered ossification, widened chondro-osseous junction) at the base of the fifth metatarsal. |
| Positive anterior drawer test (HP:6001342) | A test for ankle instability in which an anterior pull on the calcaneus with is applied with one hand while stabilizing the end of the tibia/fibula with the other hand. The test is considered positive (abnormal) if it results in more than one cm of anterior translation of the foot compared to the healthy, contralateral ankle. |
| Extended nighttime sleep (HP:0025298) | Sleeping for a longer duration than usual during the night. |
| Elevated circulating C-triol concentration (HP:6001353) | The concentration of cholestane-3beta, 5alpha, 6beta-triol (C-triol) in the blood circulation is above the upper limit of normal. C-triol is a diagnostic biomarker for Niemann-Pick disease type C. |
| Positive shoulder cross-body adduction test (HP:6001340) | A test used with suspected chronic acromioclavicular joint lesions (which are a common source of pain and disability in the shoulder). The test is considered positive with pain in the ipsilateral acromioclavicular joint when patient straightens the affected arm forward and reaches for the contralateral shoulder with extra manual cross body (adduction) pressure on the arm from the examiner. |
| Os trigonum (HP:6001349) | Os trigonum (OT) is one of the most common accessory ossicles in the foot and ankle region. In clinical practice, OT is a considerable factor that may predispose patients to posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS). Lateral ankle x-ray with foot in plantarflexion reveals an accessory ossicle at the posterior aspect of the talus, between the posterior distal tibia and calcaneal tuberosity. |
| Decreased circulating guanidinoacetic acid concentration (HP:6001352) | The concentration of guanidinoacetic acid in the blood circulation is below the lower limit of normal. |

| Anhedonia (HP:0012154) | Decreased ability to experience or feel joy or pleasure from any experience that is usually found to be pleasurable by the individual. This applies to any of the senses, e.g., taste, smell, and sound. Food may no longer be tasty, or a musical experience may no longer be enjoyable. Anhedonia also refers to an inability to feel pleasure related to activities that an affected individual previously derived pleasure from. |                  Decreased ability or inability to experience, feel, or anticipate pleasure from activities, experiences, or stimuli that are typically found pleasurable by the individual. This may involve diminished enjoyment of previously rewarding experiences (e.g., hobbies, social interactions, or sexual activity) or reduced pleasure in response to stimuli processed through the senses (e.g., music, food, or tactile contact).

This state is often characterized by a pervasive sense of emotional disconnection or detachment, where the individual may report feeling \"numb\" or lacking emotional responses that were previously present. The reduction in emotional response can range from mild dampening of emotional responses to a near-total absence of emotional engagement. It is essential to consider the individual's baseline emotional capacity, as changes may be more significant in those who previously had a wide emotional range. |
| Episodic hypersomnia (HP:0007200) | Recurrent episodes of severe hypersomnia are accompanied by cognitive and behavioral disturbances, including confusion, derealization, apathy, compulsive eating, and hypersexuality. |                  Recurrent episodes of hypersomnia (sleeping 16 or more hours a day) over a period of days or weeks. |

| Bruxism (HP:0003763) | Bruxism is characterized by the grinding of the teeth including the clenching of the jaw and typically occur during sleep, but also can occur while the affected individual is awake. |                  Bruxism is characterized by the grinding of the teeth including the clenching of the jaw and typically occur during sleep. |
| Abnormal emotional state (HP:0100851) | Emotions are complex psychological states that involve three distinct components: a subjective experience, a physiological response, and a behavioral or expressive response. In an abnormal emotional state, an affected individual shows altered intensity, frequency, or duration of emotional experiences. |                  A disturbance in the experience or expression of emotion, characterized by alterations in valence, intensity, frequency, or duration. It may also involve emotional responses that are mismatched, exaggerated, or incongruent relative to internal expectations or external contextual stimuli, such as experiencing negative affect in response to neutral or positive events. |
| Guilt (HP:6000011) | Excessive guilt is an internal feeling that is intense and considered clinically to be beyond normal range, out of proportion for the act or offense; excessive guilt is typically based on an incorrect judgment of responsibility for an unfavorable outcome.

Guilt may be proportionate to the context or disproportionate, and it may occur in the absence of an identifiable act, event, or offense. It reflects the interplay of cognitive processes, such as judgments about responsibility, and emotional responses, which can lead to persistent rumination or preoccupation. Guilt may extend to situations outside the individual's control and, in some cases, be accompanied by inaccurate or exaggerated beliefs about one's role in an outcome. |
| Sleep drunkeness (HP:6000456) | Sleep drunkenness refers to the prolonged and pronounced difficulty with awakening from nocturnal sleep and daytime naps. This symptom should be distinguished from the milder and physiologic state of sleep inertia seen even in healthy controls . |                  Sleep drunkenness refers to the prolonged and pronounced difficulty with awakening from nocturnal sleep and daytime naps. This symptom should be distinguished from the milder and physiologic state of sleep inertia seen even in healthy controls. |

| Dysregulated negative emotional state (HP:0031467) | An aversive emotional state characterized by negative emotional experiences, preoccupations, or internal states that are often related to negative perceptions of the self, the world, or the future. |                  An emotional state characterized by excessive, persistent, or contextually inappropriate negative inner experiences involving emotional arousal and valence. These experiences are often associated with negative perceptions of the self, the future, the past, or the surrounding environment, and may include affective bias such as interpreting neutral or ambiguous stimuli as negative. The intensity, duration, or impact of the state exceeds what would be expected for the individual based on their baseline emotional functioning, the context, cultural norms, or situational triggers, or when it persists despite efforts at self-regulation. |
| Hypnopompic hallucination (HP:0006896) | Brief hallucinations that occur as you wake up in the morning, in a state that falls somewhere between dreaming and being fully awake. |                  Hallucinations occurring during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. |
| Euphoria (HP:0031844) | Euphoria is an overwhelming and all-encompassing feeling of intense inner sense of joy, happiness, excitement, or elation that is far beyond and blatantly abnormal for what would typically be anticipated in the context or social circumstance. It is experienced as an unusual pleasurable feeling often with an inspirational sense of profound insight. |                  Elevation of emotional tone or mood that significantly deviates from normative affective functioning. This state is characterized by an overwhelming and all-encompassing sense of joyous well-being; it is associated with unfounded grandiosity, or grossly inflated self-esteem, rapid speech, impulsivity, and an impaired capacity for self-regulation, irrespective of context. |
| Low frustration tolerance (HP:0000744) | The feeling of frustration can be defined as an emotional reaction that occurs when a desired goal is not achieved. Frustration intolerance is defined as an age-inappropriate response to frustration, characterized by crying or temper tantrums in children, or aggressive or other undesirable behaviors. |                  The feeling of frustration can be defined as an emotional reaction that occurs when a desired goal is not achieved. Frustration intolerance is defined as an age-inappropriate response to frustration, characterized by crying or temper tantrums in children, or aggressive or other maladaptive behaviors. |
