| Term | New Text Definition |
----|----|
| Unilateral sensorineural hearing impairment (HP:0025797) | A form of sensorineural hearing impairment that affects one ear. |
| Superior displacement of the humeral head (HP:6001171) | An anterior posterior (AP) shoulder radiograph shows distance between the the proximal aspect of the humeral head and inferior aspect of the acromion of less than 7 mm. |
| Conjunctival xerosis (HP:6001193) | A condition characterized by dryness of the conjunctiva, often associated with keratinization of the conjunctival epithelium. Conjunctival xerosis is commonly linked to vitamin A deficiency, severe dry eye disease, or systemic conditions such as Sjogren syndrome. Clinical features may include a dull, rough conjunctival surface and reduced mucosal secretions. |
| Pain at the lateral aspect of the elbow (HP:6001173) | Pain localized to the radial aspect of the elbow. |
| Choroid thickening (HP:6001181) | A condition characterized by an abnormal increase in the thickness of the choroid, which may be associated with various ocular or systemic conditions. Choroid thickening can be measured using imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). |
| Discoid adrenal gland (HP:6001167) | A congenital finding where the adrenal gland does not form it's typical triangular, Y or V shape and is instead discoid, straight or elongated in shape. It is often found incidentally on renal ultrasound and is associated with renal agenesis and other renal congenital anomalies. |
| Supraclavicular nerve distribution (HP:6001169) | Localization of symptoms such as numbness or paresthesias on the skin over the upper chest, specifically above the clavicle and over the lateral aspect of the neck, corresponding to the distribution of the supraclavicular nerve. |
| Vogt striae (HP:6001180) | Vertical lines in the posterior stroma of the cornea, aligned with Descemet membrane. These lines temporarily disappear with pressure applied to the cornea. Vogt striae are a hallmark feature of keratoconus but have also been observed in healthy eyes. Rare cases of horizontal striae have been reported. |
| Omovertebral bone (HP:6001177) | An osseous connection between the superomedial border of the right scapula and C5-C6 spinous processes. |
| Clavicular edema (HP:6001178) | Swelling on the chest between the neck and the shoulder, above the clavicel (collar bone). |
| Wrist arthritis (HP:6001197) | Inflammation of the wrist joint. |
| Decreased adipose tissue (HP:0040063) | The amount of adipose tissue (fat) in the body or a part of the body is below the lower limit of normal. |
| Accessory scaphoid (HP:0004244) | Variations in the development of carpal bones are uncommon, with the scaphoid bone typically forming from the fusion of the os centrale carpi and the radial chondrification center during embryogenesis. A bipartite scaphoid is a rare congenital disorder that occurs when these ossification centers fail to fuse. |
| Partial development of the penile shaft (HP:0008708) | A congenital condition of the external male genitalia in which the shaft of the penis fails to fully develop. |
| Occupational exposure to frequent hand trauma (HP:6001195) | A history of exposure to repeated hand trauma as observed with occupations in which use of hands is frequent such as construction, food preparation and serving related occupations, and transportation and material moving occupations. |
| Forward displacement of posterior cervical dura mater on neck flexion (HP:6001191) | Flexion MRI (imaging with neutral and flexed about 30-40 degrees neck position) reveals an anterior shift of the cervical dural sac from the lamina in the region of C4 to C7. |
| Corneal epithelial edema (HP:6001182) | A condition characterized by accumulation of fluid within the corneal epithelium, leading to swelling, blurred vision, and discomfort. It is often associated with increased intraocular pressure, endothelial dysfunction, or contact lens overuse. Clinical features may include a hazy cornea and microcystic changes visible on slit-lamp examination. |
| Preauricular lymphadenopathy (HP:6001188) | Enlargement of one or more lymph nodes located in front of the ear. |
| Abnormal scaphoid morphology (HP:0004243) | Any structural anomaly of the scaphoid. The scaphoid is the largest bone of the proximal row of carpal bones. It is located on the same side as the thumb. |
| Filamentary keratitis (HP:6001184) | A condition characterized by the formation of filaments composed of degenerated epithelial cells and mucus attached to the corneal surface. It is associated with symptoms such as pain, foreign body sensation, photophobia, and tearing. Filamentary keratitis is often linked to underlying conditions such as dry eye disease, post-surgical ocular surface disorders, or systemic diseases like Sjoegren syndrome. |
| Abnormal hamate bone morphology (HP:0004259) | A structural anomaly of the hamate bone, which is the ulnar-most bone located within the distal row of carpal bones, neighboured by the capitate bone radially. |
| Mucocutaneous lesion painful (HP:0025803) | Applies to pain that colocalizes with lesions in the skin or mucous membranes. |
| Ulnar wrist pain (HP:6001200) | An unpleasant sensation characterized by physical discomfort (such as pricking, throbbing, or aching) localized to the ulnar side of the wrist. |
| Limited shoulder internal rotation (HP:6001170) | Difficulty rotating the lower part of the arm towards the body (tested with the elbow flexed and the elbow held next to the side of the body or shoulder 90 degrees abducted to the side) secondary to pain, weakness, or mechanical block. |
| Onychoheterotopia (HP:6001189) | Growth of nail tissue outside the ungual plate, generally in the finger. |
| Abnormal MHC surface expression (HP:6001190) | A deviation from the normal level of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed at the cell surface. The cell-mediated adaptive immune response is regulated by the MHC, which is called human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in humans. HLA molecules are cell surface glycoproteins whose primary function is to present endogenous and exogenous antigens to T lymphocytes for recognition and response. The HLA molecules that present antigen to T lymphocytes are divided into two main classes: HLA class I and HLA class II molecules. |
| Pain at the medial aspect of the elbow (HP:6001175) | Pain localized to the medial aspect of the elbow. |
| Scapholunate interval widening (HP:6001198) | Widening of the space between the scaphoid and lunate on x-ray; scapholunate dissociation. |
| Retinal shunt vessels (HP:6001183) | bnormal blood vessels in the retina that form as a response to vascular occlusion, serving as bypass channels to redirect blood flow around obstructed or damaged retinal vessels. Retinal shunt vessels are often associated with conditions like retinal vein occlusion or diabetic retinopathy and may appear as tortuous or dilated vessels on fundoscopic examination. |
| Optic disc hemorrhage (HP:6001186) | A condition characterized by bleeding at or near the optic disc, visible as a flame-shaped or splinter hemorrhage on fundoscopic examination. |

| Spongiosis (HP:6001166) | Spongiosis refers to the increased intercellular edema in the epidermis resulting in the pulling away of the keratinocytes from their surrounding desmosomes. Histologically, the spongiotic tissue reaction pattern involves the accumulation of fluid in the intercellular spaces of the epidermis, making the desmosomes junctions more easy to appreciate. Parakeratosis forms above the areas of spongiosis. The foci of spongiosis can be microscopic to grossly identifiable clinically with vesicles or bullae. |

Generally, acute compartment syndrome is considered a clinical diagnosis. However, ICP over 30 mmHg can be used as a threshold to aid in diagnosis. |
