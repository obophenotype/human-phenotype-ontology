To perform the test, the foot is placed at an angle of 90 degrees with the leg, the calcaneofibular ligament is perpendicular and the anterior talofibular ligament is parallel to the long axis of the talus.

| Gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (HP:0003164) | Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD) is characterized by inappropriately low serum concentrations of the gonadotropins LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) in the presence of low circulating concentrations of sex steroids (primarily testosterone or estradiol). GnRH is not typically assayed directly because it is released in pulses from the hypothalamus, and its concentration can fluctuate rapidly and in a complex pattern that makes single blood measurements less informative than the pituitary's response. |

| Aberrant right subclavian artery (HP:0031632) | Abnormal origin of the right subclavian artery from the descending aorta. The right subclavian artery normally arises from the brachiocephalic trunk, which divides into the right common carotid artery and right subclavian artery. |                  Abnormal origin of the right subclavian artery from the descending aorta. The right subclavian artery normally arises from the brachiocephalic trunk, which divides into the right common carotid artery and right subclavian artery. |
| Elevated circulating reverse T3 concentration (HP:0034288) | Abnormally increased concentration of reverse T3 (3,3',5'-triiodothyronine or rT3) in the blood circulation. |                  Concentration of reverse T3 (3,3',5'-triiodothyronine or rT3) in the blood circulation is above the upper limit of normal. |
| Hyperkeratosis (HP:0000962) | Hyperkeratosis is thickening of the epidermis involving the outer layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, which is composed of large, polyhedral, plate-like envelopes filled with keratin which are the dead cells that have migrated up from the stratum granulosum. |                  Hyperkeratosis is a histopathological term defining a thickened stratum corneum and may be present in many different skin conditions, with many possible overlaps. Hyperkeratosis refers to the increased thickness of the stratum corneum, the outer layer of the skin. Hyperkeratosis is subclassified as orthokeratotic or parakeratotic. Orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis refers to the thickening of the keratin layer with preserved keratinocyte maturation, while parakeratotic hyperkeratosis shows retained nuclei as a sign of delayed maturation of keratinocytes. |
| Dyspareunia (HP:0030016) | Recurrent or persistent genital pain associated with sexual intercourse. |                  Recurrent or persistent genital pain associated with sexual intercourse. |
| Sepsis (HP:0100806) | Systemic inflammatory response to infection. |                  Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. |
| Elevated urinary saccharopine level (HP:6000283) | The amount of saccharopine in the urine, when normalized to urine concentration, is above the upper limit of normal. |                  The amount of saccharopine in the urine, when normalized to urine concentration, is above the upper limit of normal. |
| Radial ray deficiency (HP:0006433) | Radial dysplasia, also known as radial longitudinal deficiency, includes radial clubhand and is a disfiguring, and potentially disabling, congenital limb anomaly. The entire upper limb may be involved, although the defect is most evident in the forearm and hand. Affected children suffer a variable degree of hypoplasia or absence of the preaxial skeleton and soft tissues, in particular the thumb, radius, and dorsoradial soft tissues. The hand is usually radially deviated and subluxated off the distal aspect of the ulna, the ulna may be shortened and have a bow-shaped deformity, and there is no true wrist (radiocarpal) joint in Bayne2 type-III and IV radial dysplasia. |                  Radial dysplasia, also known as radial longitudinal deficiency, includes radial clubhand and is a disfiguring, and potentially disabling, congenital limb anomaly.

| Air crescent (HP:0033661) | An air crescent is a collection of air in a crescentic shape that separates the wall of a cavity from an inner mass. The air crescent sign is often considered characteristic of either Aspergillus colonization of preexisting cavities or retraction of infarcted lung in angioinvasive aspergillosis. However, the air crescent sign has also been reported in other conditions, including tuberculosis, Wegener granulomatosis, intracavitary hemorrhage, and lung cancer. |                  An air crescent is a collection of air in a crescentic shape that separates the wall of a cavity from an inner mass. The air crescent sign is often considered characteristic of either Aspergillus colonization of preexisting cavities or retraction of infarcted lung in angioinvasive aspergillosis. However, the air crescent sign has also been reported in other conditions, including tuberculosis, Wegener granulomatosis, intracavitary hemorrhage, and lung cancer. The crescent can be seen in both plain X-ray and CT scan. |
| Ataxia (HP:0001251) | Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- or overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly). |                  Ataxia refers to impaired coordination of voluntary muscle movement. Cerebellar ataxia refers to ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. This causes a variety of elementary neurological deficits including asynergy (lack of coordination between muscles, limbs and joints), dysmetria (lack of ability to judge distances that can lead to under- or overshoot in grasping movements), and dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid movements requiring antagonizing muscle groups to be switched on and off repeatedly). |
| Recurrent bacterial vaginosis (HP:0030683) | Inflammation of the vagina that can result from a spectrum of conditions that cause vaginal and sometimes vulvar symptoms, such as itching, burning, irritation, odor, and vaginal discharge. |                  Repeated symptomatic episodes of inflammation of the vagina that can result from a spectrum of conditions that cause vaginal and sometimes vulvar symptoms, such as itching, burning, irritation, odor, and vaginal discharge. |
| Recurrent infections (HP:0002719) | Increased susceptibility to infections. |                  Increased susceptibility to infections as manifested by repeated bouts of infection. |
