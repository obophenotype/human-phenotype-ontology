In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous.

| obsolete Subhyaloid hemorrhage (HP:0025239) | A localized detachment of the vitreous from the retina due to the accumulation of blood. When localized in the macular area, it results in sudden profound loss of vision. Subhyaloid premacular hemorrhage is typically characterized by a circumscribed, round or dumb-bell shaped, bright red mound of blood beneath the internal limiting membrane (ILM) or between the ILM and hyaloid face, in or near to the central macular area. |
| obsolete Focal sub-RPE deposits (HP:0031532) | Deposits accumulating between the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's membrane and that are distributed in a single focus. |
| obsolete Central fundal arteriolar microaneurysms (HP:0008014) | Microscopic aneurysms of the retinal arterioles near the central part of the fundus, visible as small round dark red dots on the retinal surface (not arising from visible vessels) that are by definition less than the diameter of the major optic veins as they cross the optic disc. |
| obsolete Macular microaneurysm/hemorrhage (HP:0030494) | Small, red dots in the superficial retinal layers (it is difficult to distinguish between small hemorrhages and microaneurysms). |
| obsolete Multifocal subretinal deposits (HP:0031530) | Deposits accumulating between the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium and that are distributed with multiple foci. |
| obsolete Focal subretinal deposits (HP:0031529) | Deposits accumulating between the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium and that have a focal distribution. |
| obsolete Decreased CD3+ T cell proportion (HP:0045080) | Any abnormality in the proportion of CD3-positive T cells relative to the total number of T cells. |
| obsolete Foveal depigmentation (HP:0500088) | Loss of pigment in the fovea centralis. |
