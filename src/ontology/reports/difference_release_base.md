Lesions occur in crops over days to weeks and are evanescent. The rate of migration is 2 to 12 mm over a period of a few hours. Erythema marginatum tends to affect the trunk more than the extremities and to not be accompanied by pruritus. |

| Diminished sulfotransferase activity in cultured fibroblasts (HP:6000970) | Rate of proteoglycan sulfation (sulfotransferase activity) is below the lower limit of normal in cultured fibroblasts. |
| Small intestinal adenoma (HP:6001040) | A small bowel tumor with adenomatous epithelium. |
| Delayed toe phalanx ossification (HP:6000952) | Delayed maturation and calcification of any of the toe phalanges. |
| Tongue muscle weakness (HP:0000183) | Reduced strength of the tongue musculature, resulting in difficulties moving the tongue and possible accompanied by dysarthria or dysphagia. |
| Anti-lipoprotein lipase autoantibody positivity (HP:6001060) | The presence of autoantibodies (immunoglobulins) in the blood circulation that react against anti-lipoprotein lipase. |
| Excessive piloerection (HP:6000958) | Abnormally increased degree of goose bump formation, that is, of involuntary formation of bumps on a person's skin at the base of body hairs. |
| Breast cyst (HP:6001046) | A benign, fluid-filled sac in the breast. |

| Thumb hypoplasia grade 3A (HP:6000940) | A type of developmental undergrowth of the thumb, whereby there are musculotendinous and osseous deficiencies with the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint intact. Absence of active motion at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) or interphalangeal (IP) joint. |
| Reduced posterior scleral thickness (HP:0025752) | A reduction in the height of the posterior portion of the sclera. |
| Idiosyncratic use of words (HP:0025774) | Words or phrases and their expression that are used in a manner that is not consistent with the current and accepted meaning for the context and social circumstance. This does not apply to peer or culture driven novel uses of words that are accepted within the given social circles. |
| Fungal hair infection (HP:6001088) | Demonstration of fungi growing on hair by a method such as microscopy of hairs mounted on slides with 10% potassium hydroxide. |
| Fractured scaphoid bone (HP:6001107) | A partial or complete breakage of the scaphoid bone. |
