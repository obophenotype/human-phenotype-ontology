The TFCC is a load-bearing structure between the lunate, triquetrum, and ulnar head. The function of the TFCC is to act as a stabilizer for the ulnar aspect of the wrist. The TFCC is at risk for either acute or chronic degenerative injury. |

----|----|
| obsolete Impaired leukocyte adhesion (HP:0033798) | During states of inflammation, white blood cells (leukocytes) play a key role in maintaining tissue homeostasis through elimination of pathogens and removal of damaged tissue. Leukocytes migrate to the site of inflammation by crawling over and through the blood vessel wall, into the tissue. This term refers to a defect in the attachment of leukocytes to the blood vessel wall, which is a key step required before they can pass through gaps of the endothelial cells of the blood vessel wall to migrate to the site of inflammation. |
| obsolete Abnormal proportion of central memory CD4-positive T cells (HP:0410381) | An abnormal proportion of central memory CD4-positive, alpha-beta memory T cells compared to the total number of T cells in the blood. These cells have the phenotype of CCR7-positive, CD127-positive, CD45RA-negative, CD45RO-positive, and CD25-negative. |
| obsolete Decreased proportion of CD4-positive helper T cells (HP:0005407) | A decreased proportion of circulating CD4-positive helper T cells relative to total T cell count. |
| obsolete Reduced reactive oxygen species production in neutrophils (HP:0025632) | An abnormal reduction in the amount of reactive oxygen produced by neutrophils in the respiratory burst. |
| obsolete Impaired neutrophil killing of staphylococci (HP:0005512) | A reduction in the ability of neutrophils to kill the gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus, which is commonly known as staph. |

| obsolete Impaired T cell function (HP:0005435) | Abnormally reduced ability of T cells to perform their functions in cell-mediated immunity. |
| obsolete Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect (HP:0011605) | A congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries with a ventricular septal defect: a hole between the two bottom chambers (ventricles) of the heart. The ventricular septal defect is centered around the most superior aspect of the ventricular septum. |
| obsolete Increased helper T cell proportion (HP:0500264) | Increased proportion of helper T cells relative to the total number of T cells. |
| obsolete Reduced natural killer cell activity (HP:0012178) | Reduced ability of the natural killer cell to function in the adaptive immune response. |
