<summary>Text definitions added: 9</summary>

| Term | New Text Definition |
----|----|
| Trochanteric pain (HP:6001158) | An unpleasant sensation characterized by physical discomfort (such as pricking, throbbing, or aching) localized to the structures around the greater trochanter (the bony prominence on the outer part of the femur). |
| Finger mass (HP:6001163) | An abnormal enlargement or swelling localized to a finger. |
| Poor R-wave progression (HP:6001161) | Absence of the normal increase in size of the R wave in the precordial leads when advancing from lead V1 to V6 of the electrocardiogram. |
| Pulsatile mass in extremity (HP:6001159) | A noticeable lump or swelling in the arm or leg that you can feel with you fingers and this lump is beating or pulsating, similar to the feeling of a heartbeat. |
| Synovial crystals (HP:6001156) | The presence of microscopic crystalline structures in the synovial fluid (the lubricating fluid within joint cavities). |
| Foot mass (HP:6001164) | An abnormal enlargement or swelling localized to a foot. |
| Prominent V1-V2 R wave (HP:6001162) | The R wave in leads V1-V2 is normally considerably smaller in amplitude than the S wave in the same leads. Prominent R wave in these leads implies the R wave is larger than the S-wave, which may indicate cardiovascular pathology. This term includes Tall R wave in lead V1, which is defined by a R/S ratio greater than 1. |
| Abnormal R wave (HP:6001160) | Any anomaly of the R wave of the EKG, which is the first upward deflection after the P wave. The R wave reflects early ventricular depolarisation. |
| Occupational exposure to frequent kneeling (HP:6001157) | A history of exposure to frequent squatting/kneeling and/or heavy lifting. |
