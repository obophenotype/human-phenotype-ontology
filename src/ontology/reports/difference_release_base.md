----|----|
| Tibialis anterior tendon rupture (HP:6001275) | Partial or complete breakage (rupture) of the tibialis anterior tendon (TAT). The TAT is the principal dorsiflexor of the ankle joint and secondary invertor of the foot. It has important roles in the different stages of gait; in the swing phase, it concentrically dorsiflex the ankle for foot clearance and during plantarflexion of the ankle in the stance phase, it eccentrically contract to stabilize the ankle and prevent damage to the foot and ankle. Clinically, presentations in acute lacerations or direct trauma cases are straight forward, in chronic and atraumatic cases usually the symptoms at the time of TAT rupture are more subtle. Other manifestations include mild pain, localized mass, palpable gap, loss of strength, instability during gait, gait disturbances with forefoot dropping and stumbling and high stepping gait. |
| Abnormal methacholine challenge test (HP:6001277) | An abnormal result of the methacholine challenge test, which is a bronchoprovocation technique used to evaluate airway hyperresponsiveness, particularly in patients with suspected asthma. |
| Medial rotation of the medial malleolus (HP:0008132) | Hindfoot valgus (posterior part of the foot turns outward) in combination with forefoot abduction (front part of the foot (the forefoot) is angled outwards away from the midline of the body, relative to the hindfoot) and lowering of the midfoot. |
| Thumb sign (HP:6001274) | The distal phalanx of the adducted thumb extends beyond the ulnar border of the palm (The thumb protrudes from the clenched fist). |
| Rapid neurologic deterioration (HP:0007307) | Loss of neurological function in a time frame that is considered relatively quick, for instance, loss of a develomental milestone or substantial exacerbation of neurological complications such as seizures or feeding difficulties within a few months. |
| Decreased circulating ADAMTS13 activity (HP:6001276) | Activity of the enzyme von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) in the blood circulation below the lower limit of normal. |
| Clinical anophthalmos (HP:0020001) | Congenital anophthalmos is a rare ocular anomaly in which histologically detectable eyeball structures are absent due to poor development of the primary optic nerve vesicle. However, with appropriate imaging or intraoperatively, rudimentary remains of this structure can usually be detected. Therefore, the term clinical congenital anophthalmos seems more appropriate and denotes a phenotypic range between microphthalmos and anophthalmos. |
| Abnormal cecum morphology (HP:0025002) | A structural anomaly of the cecum, which is the proximal blind pouch of the ascending colon, is located at the ileocecal junction in the right iliac fossa. |
| Ileal stricture (HP:0020002) | A pathological narrowing of the ileum that is caused by the development of a ring of scar tissue that constricts the ileal lumen. |
