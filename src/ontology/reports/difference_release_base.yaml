new_value: intracompartmental pressure (ICP) over 30 mmHg. Acute compartment syndrome
  occurs when there is increased pressure within a closed osteofascial compartment,
  resulting in impaired local circulation. Acute compartment syndrome is considered
  a surgical emergency since, without proper treatment, it can lead to ischemia and
  eventually necrosis. Generally, acute compartment syndrome is considered a clinical
  diagnosis. However, ICP over 30 mmHg can be used as a threshold to aid in diagnosis.

  mesangial sclerosis presents with nephrotic syndrome at birth or within the first
  year of life. Glomeruli are small and condensed in appearance, with early lesions
  showing increased loose mesangial collagen that progress to sclerosis with dense
  collagen without hypercellularity. Podocytes do not show hyperplasia but may be
  immature and cobblestone-like. Electron microscopy shows extensive foot process
  effacement without deposits, but increased collagen within mesangial areas.

new_value: Spongiosis refers to the increased intercellular edema in the epidermis
  resulting in the pulling away of the keratinocytes from their surrounding desmosomes.
  Histologically, the spongiotic tissue reaction pattern involves the accumulation
  of fluid in the intercellular spaces of the epidermis, making the desmosomes junctions
  more easy to appreciate. Parakeratosis forms above the areas of spongiosis. The
  foci of spongiosis can be microscopic to grossly identifiable clinically with vesicles
  or bullae.
