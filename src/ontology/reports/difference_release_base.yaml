old_value: An atrial septal defect characterized by a deficiency in the tissue separating
  the coronary sinus from the left atrium (LA). This results in partial or complete
  unroofing of the coronary sinus leading to a predominantly left-to-right shunt through
  the coronary sinus (LA to coronary sinus to right atrium [RA]). The orifice of the
  ostium is frequently large because of the increased flow. From the RA side, the
  defect is located at the level of the coronary sinus ostium and may also include
  some deficiency in atrial tissue around the ostium. From the LA side, the size can
  be variable depending on the degree of unroofing of the coronary sinus.

  partial (either focal or fenestrated) or complete absence of the roof of the CS,
  which results in a communication between the CS and the LA. Unroofed CS is the rarest
  type of atrial septal defect. It is often associated with persistent left superior
  vena cava (LSVC) and other forms of complex congenital heart disease, usually heterotaxia
  syndromes.

new_value: The inability to rotate the proximal or upper limb segment laterally past
  anatomic neutral moving away from the midline, when viewed from anteriorly. Anatomic
  neutral position is defined as the trans-epicondylar axis of the distal humerus
  (for upper extremity) or femur (for lower extremity) is parallel to the sagittal
  plane of the body. This type of contracture is characterized by a turning of the
  knee from a neutral position to one facing more the midline, where the neutral position
  for the hip is with knee pointing directly anteriorly (less than or equal to 45
  degrees).

new_value: Abnormal occipitofrontal diameter (OFD) refers to a fetal head width measurement,
  taken between the root of the nose to the most prominent part of the occiput on
  an ultrasound image that lies outside the expected range for a given gestational
  age. The expected range typically falls between the 3rd percentile (or more than
  2 standard deviations below the mean) and the 97th percentile (or more than 2 standard
  deviations above the mean).

new_value: Lack of uniformity in the morphology of the retinal pigment epithelium

  between the neurosensory retina (photoreceptors) and Bruch membrane/choroid, and
  normally appears as a thin, hyperreflective (bright) band on OCT imaging. This term
  comprises irregularities which may manifest as thickening, thinning, undulations,
  or loss of normal reflectivity, potentially affecting retinal structure or function.

old_value: The essence of the lesion is the combination of discordant atrioventricular
  and ventriculo-arterial connections. Thus, the morphologically right atrium is connected
  to a morphologically left ventricle across the mitral valve, with the left ventricle
  then connected to the pulmonary trunk. The morphologically left atrium is connected
  to the morphologically right ventricle across the tricuspid valve, with the morphologically
  right ventricle connected to the aorta.
new_value: Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) is a
  discordance of atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial connections. The anatomy
  of ccTGA involves systemic venous drainage to the morphologic right atrium (mRA),
  which is connected via the mitral valve to the morphologic left ventricle (mLV)
  whose outflow is the pulmonary arterial system. The pulmonary venous drainage arrives
  at the morphologic left atrium (mLA), which crosses the tricuspid valve into the
  morphologic right ventricle (mRV) with outflow into the systemic arterial system.
  In isolation, ccTGA has an in-series circulation without mixing; therefore, the
  presence or absence of associated defects dictates the patient's clinical presentation.

  The 3rd arc (white) outlines the proximal surfaces of the capitate and hamate. Disruption
  of carpal arcs (i.e., the arcs appear broken or discontinuous on radiographs) indicates
  a fracture or ligamentous injury in the wrist.

  most frequent complication following manual extracapsular cataract extraction. Secondary
  cataract results from the proliferation and migration of residual epithelial cells
  in the posterior region of the lens capsule into the visual axis, leading to thickening
  and reduction in transparency (opacification), which in turn can cause a decrease
  in visual acuity.

new_value: Glomerular basement membrane duplication (GBM-DP) can be seen with Periodic
  acid-Schiff and silver stains. This appearance results from the presence of subendothelial
  deposits and the so-called mesangial interposition whereby mesangial cells, infiltrating
  mononuclear cells, or even portions of endothelial cells interpose themselves between
  the endothelium and basement membrane, with new, inner GBM-like material being laid
  down. This produces a double contour or tram-track appearance on light or electron
  microscopy. This finding often reflects splitting of the lamina densa and is associated
  with disease processes such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, transplant
  glomerulopathy, and diabetic nephropathy.

type: NewTextDefinition
new_value: The concentration of lysosphingomyelin in the blood circulation is above
  the upper limit of normal. Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) or Niemann-Pick
  type A/B is a lysosomal disorder caused by the deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase
  (ASM) due to pathogenic variants in the SMPD1 gene. Sphingomyelin (SM) is the substrate
  for ASM that cleaves the phosphorylcholine linkage of SM producing ceramide. SM
  is a major compound of most cell membranes and coupled with cholesterol constitutes
  most of the membrane rafts. In the deficiency of ASM, there is primary storage of
  SM, and the concentration of lysosphingomyelin in dried blood spots and in the blood
  circulation is typically elevated.

  collateral ligament (MCL), specifically the anterior bundle (AMCL). In the valgus
  stress test, the elbow is placed in 20 to 30 degrees of flexion with the forearm
  supinated and a valgus stress is applied. The test is positive when no firm end
  point is palpated, greater than 1 mm of medial joint opening is noted (fluoroscopically),
  or there is reproduction of the patient's pain.
