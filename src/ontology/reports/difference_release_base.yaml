new_value: An anomaly that can be ascertained by iron-specific magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) sequences such as gradient-echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted
  imaging (SWI). Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system is a chronic
  condition due to persistent or repeated long-term bleeding into the subarachnoid
  space, leading to subpial hemosiderin deposition. Hemosiderin deposition on MRI
  is seen as a T2 hypointensity and preferentially outlines the cerebellum and brainstem
  surface.

old_value: A reduction in the rate of apoptosis in lymphocytes.
new_value: Abnormal decrease of apoptosis by peripheral blood T cells in an in vitro
  culture, compared to a healthy control sample. May be either spontaneous, induced

  serine labelled by Annexin V, but other methods such as staning of cleaved Caspases
  may be used by different laboratories.

new_value: Opisthotonus is defined as a dramatic abnormal posture due to spastic contraction
  of the extensor muscles of the neck, trunk, and lower extremities that produces
  a severe backward arching from neck to heel. In most cases, the trunk is elevated
  off the ground by a few inches. It is usually sudden in onset and can be sustained
  or repetitive. It can be considered a variant of decerebrate posturing involving
  a hyperextension of the neck, back, and limbs.

old_value: During states of inflammation, white blood cells (leukocytes) play a key
  role in maintaining tissue homeostasis through elimination of pathogens and removal
  of damaged tissue. Leukocytes migrate to the site of inflammation by crawling over
  and through the blood vessel wall, into the tissue. This term refers to a defect
  in the attachment of leukocytes to the blood vessel wall, which is a key step required
  before they can pass through gaps of the endothelial cells of the blood vessel wall
  to migrate to the site of inflammation.

old_value: Lack of natural killer cells, a type of lymphocyte in the innate immune
  system that contains cytoplasmic granzymes, i.e., small granules with perforin and
  proteases that allow natural killer cells to form pores in the cell membrane of
  the target cell through which the granzymes and associated molecules can enter,
  inducing apoptosis.
new_value: Absence of detectable circulating NK cells, commonly characterized as CD3-CD19-
  and CD16+ or CD56+ lymphocytes, in the blood. Usually, less than 20 cells per microlitre
  is considered to be an absence.

  and brainstem, most commonly the superior vermis, quadrigeminal plate, and basal

  The MRI of the spinal cord may reveal myelomalacia, syringomyelia, owl-eyes, or
  snake-eyes signs. The most common etiology for classic or primary infratentorial
  superficial siderosis is spinal dural defects, often dural tears.

new_value: Medial epicondyle apophysitis (MEA), also known as little league elbow,
  is an overuse injury prevalent among adolescent athletes whose sport involves repetitive
  overhand throwing, racket use, or other overhead arm motions. The medial epicondyle
  is a bony protrusion on the medial elbow with its own ossification center, separate
  from the main distal humeral physis, known as an apophysis. Medial epicondyle apophysitis
  occurs due to excessive and repetitive valgus stress placed on the apophysis before
  its closure. Over time, the repetitive strain results in a traction-type injury
  and may cause pathologic widening and inflammation of the apophysis or even an avulsion
  fracture.
