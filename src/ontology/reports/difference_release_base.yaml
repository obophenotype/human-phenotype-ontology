new_value: Delusional memory is a memory that is false or fantastically distorted,
  but held with firm and irrefutable conviction despite evidence to the contrary.

  or have a basis in an actual event that has been grossly misinterpreted or altered
  by the individual's mind.

  foreskin over the glans promptly after the initial retraction can lead to paraphimosis.

new_value: The monospot test is a latex agglutination test which utilizes equine erythrocytes
  as the primary substrate and tests for specific heterophile antibodies produced
  by the human immune system in response to EBV infection. When these specific antibodies
  are present in the patient's blood specimen, exposure to equine erythrocytes will
  lead to clumping of the sample, thus signaling a positive agglutination reaction.

new_value: In diabetes insipidus, affected individuals produce large quantities of
  dilute urine. In nephrogenic DI, the kidneys do not respond to vasopressin. In a
  water deprivation test or with administration of exogenous vasopressin, the osmolaltiy
  of the urine does not increase as normally.

type: NewTextDefinition
new_value: An abnormality of the vestibulospinal (VS) reflexes, which contribute to
  the control of postural orientation. In this task, they continuously collaborate
  with reflexes elicited by stimulation of visual and somatosensory receptors. Labyrinthine
  receptors are sensitive to modifications (i) of the head position with respect to
  the earth vertical or (ii) of the angular/linear velocity of head motion in space.
  This information can be used to monitor deviations from the maintained body position.

new_value: An abnormal result of the xylose absorption test that is used to assess
  the ability of the intestines to absorb D-xylose. D-xylose is a five-carbon monosaccharide
  found in some plants. The patient drinks a solution containing a specific amount
  of D-xylose and the concentration of xylose is measured in the blood circulation
  and then in the urine. A low amount of D-xylose indicates reduced small intestinal
  absorbtion.

old_value: Fine, rapid twitching of individual muscle fibers with little or no movement
  of the muscle as a whole. If a motor neuron or its axon is destroyed, the muscle
  fibers it innervates undergo denervation atrophy. This leads to hypersensitivity
  of individual muscle fibers to acetyl choline so that they may contract spontaneously.
  Isolated activity of individual muscle fibers is generally so fine it cannot be
  seen through the intact skin, although it can be recorded as a short-duration spike
  in the EMG.

  annotation using specific terms in other branchs of the Atypical behavior subontology,
  but if this is not possible, then terms from this branch may be used.

type: NewTextDefinition
new_value: The urine anion gap (UAG), calculated as [(Na+ + K+) - (Cl-)] has been
  used to roughly estimate whether urine ammonium is increased or decreased in the
  evaluation of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The more ammonium in the urine,
  the lower the UAG is, which achieves negative values within a wide range (0 to -200
  mEq/L) during hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. In patients with distal renal tubular
  acidosis (RTA) of several etiologies, the UAG is positive, despite the prevailing
  metabolic acidosis, and this is a useful bedside diagnostic index of impaired ammonium
  excretion.

  distinguishes racing thoughts from flight of ideas. Racing thoughts may however,
  co-occur with or be independent from flight of ideas, they may be associated with
  pressured speech or be an internal perception of the rate of thinking. The core
  element being the rate of the thoughts themselves.

new_value: A positive result of the tuberculin skin test suggesting previous expouse
  or infection with mycobacterium teberculosis. A standard dose of five tuberculin
  units (TU) (0.1ml) is injected intradermally (into the skin) and read 48 to 72 h
  later. A person who has been exposed to the bacteria is expected to mount an immune
  response in the skin containing the bacterial proteins. The volar aspect of the
  forearm is the preferred site of test. The basis of reading is the presence or absence
  of induration, which may be determined by inspection (from a side view against the
  light as well as by direct light) and by palpation. For standardization, the diameter
  of induration should be measured transversely to the long axis of the forearm and
  recorded in millimeters.
