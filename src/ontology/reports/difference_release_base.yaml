id: uuid:aab25d5a-1e88-4db0-9004-8eefc48dd540
type: NewTextDefinition
new_value: Partial or complete breakage (rupture) of the tibialis anterior tendon
  (TAT). The TAT is the principal dorsiflexor of the ankle joint and secondary invertor
  of the foot. It has important roles in the different stages of gait; in the swing
  phase, it concentrically dorsiflex the ankle for foot clearance and during plantarflexion
  of the ankle in the stance phase, it eccentrically contract to stabilize the ankle
  and prevent damage to the foot and ankle. Clinically, presentations in acute lacerations
  or direct trauma cases are straight forward, in chronic and atraumatic cases usually
  the symptoms at the time of TAT rupture are more subtle. Other manifestations include
  mild pain, localized mass, palpable gap, loss of strength, instability during gait,
  gait disturbances with forefoot dropping and stumbling and high stepping gait.

new_value: Congenital anophthalmos is a rare ocular anomaly in which histologically
  detectable eyeball structures are absent due to poor development of the primary
  optic nerve vesicle. However, with appropriate imaging or intraoperatively, rudimentary
  remains of this structure can usually be detected. Therefore, the term clinical
  congenital anophthalmos seems more appropriate and denotes a phenotypic range between
  microphthalmos and anophthalmos.
