  An epiretinal membrane area can develop on the thin macular area of the retin. An
  epiretinal membrane is also sometimes called a macular pucker, premacular fibrosis,
  surface wrinkling retinopathy or cellophane maculopathy.
new_value: An epiretinal membrane is a thin sheet of fibrous tissue on the surface
  of the retina along the inner limiting membrane. It appears as a greyish semi-translucent
  avascular membrane over the internal limiting membrane (ILM) on the surface of the
  retina.

new_value: Any deviation from the normal ratio of testosterone and estradiol (the
  primary sex steroids) to each other. The testosterone:estradiol ratio is derived
  from total testosterone in ng/dL and total estradiol in pg/mL, and expressed as
  T:E. Normal ranges are affected by sex, age, and other factors.

old_value: A lesion that is observed following light damage to the macula. Damage
  to the retinal by exposure to intense visible light, usually the sun. Intense light
  exposure such as staring at the sun causes fine structural anomalies in the outer
  segments of the photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells of
  the macula. Symptoms usually develop within 1 to 4 h after exposure and include
  decreased vision, metamorphopsia, micropsia, and central or paracentral scotomas.
  Fundus examination typically shows a small yellow spot with a surrounding gray zone
  in the foveolar or parafoveolar area. Spontaneous evolution leads to the improvement
  of visual acuity.
new_value: A lesion that is observed acutely following light damage to the macula,
  typically smaller than 200 micrometers. Damage to the retinal by exposure to intense
  visible light, usually the sun. Intense light exposure such as staring at the sun
  causes fine structural anomalies in the outer segments of the photoreceptors and
  the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells of the macula. Such lesions can also
  be laser-induced.

old_value: In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new
  vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina,
  NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina
  and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence
  leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous
  gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina.
  Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts
  the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact
  and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to
  as traction retinal detachment.
new_value: In ischemic retinal disease, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting
  of new vessels from pre-existent vessels. Ischemia invariably leads to the upregulation
  of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) production. Most frequently the new
  vessels grow internal to the plane of the retina. However, intraretinal proliferation
  of new vessels can also occur.

old_value: An increased concentration of a surfactant protein in the blood circulation.
  Pulmonary surfactant is a highly surface-active mixture of proteins and lipids that
  is synthesized and secreted onto the alveoli by type II epithelial cells. The protein
  part of surfactant constitutes of four types of surfactant proteins (SP), SP-A,
  SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins that regulate surfactant
  metabolism and have immunologic functions. These two proteins are detectable in
  the bloodstream and an elevated level may reflect idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
new_value: The concentration of surfactant protein in the blood circulation is above
  the upper limit of normal.

old_value: Syncope is a syndrome in which loss of consciousness is of relatively sudden
  onset, temporary (usually less than 1 to 2 minutes), self-terminating, and of usually
  rapid recovery. Syncope leads to a generalized weakness of muscles with loss of
  postural tone, inability to stand upright, and loss of consciousness. Once the patient
  is in a horizontal position, blood flow to the brain is no longer hindered by gravitation
  and consciousness is regained. Unconsciousness usually lasts for seconds to minutes.
  Headache and drowsiness (which usually follow seizures) do not follow a syncopal
  attack. Syncope results from a sudden impairment of brain metabolism usually due
  to a reduction in cerebral blood flow.
new_value: A transient loss of consciousness (i.e., characterized by a rapid onset,
  a short duration, and a spontaneous and complete recovery) due to cerebral hypoperfusion.

  MEGDEL syndrome (3-MethylGlutaconic aciduria, Deafness, Encephalopathy, Leigh-like
  syndrome MIM #614739). In stage 1 of the disease, T2 signal changes of the pallidum
  are present. In stage 2, swelling of the putamen and caudate nucleus is seen. The
  dorsal putamen contains an eye that shows no signal alteration and (thus) seems
  to be spared during this stage of the disease. It later increases, reflecting progressive
  putaminal involvement. Sparing of the mid dorsal putamen (showing normal signal
  surrounded by T2 hyperintense signal) is referred to as the putaminal eye.'

new_value: inflammation of the costal cartilage (the cartilage that connects the ribs
  to the sternum). The typical presentation of costochondritis is bilateral parasternal
  chest wall pain exacerbated by deep breaths, coughing, and stretching. The upper
  (predominantly second through fifth) costochondral and/or costosternal junctions
  are most commonly involved. The areas of tenderness are not generally accompanied
  by heat, erythema, or localized swelling.

old_value: A congenital defect of the macula distinct from coloboma associated with
  optic fissure closure defects. Macular coloboma is characterized by a sharply defined,
  rather large defect in the central area of the fundus that is oval or round, and
  coarsely pigmented.
new_value: A so-called macular coloboma is characterized by a sharply defined, usually
  excavated, area without neuroretina and RPE tissues in the central area of the fundus.
  This lesion is not related to classical colobomas associated with optic fissure
  closure defects.
