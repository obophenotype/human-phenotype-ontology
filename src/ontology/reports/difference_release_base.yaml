old_value: Experience of intense or excessively negative feelings that may include
  profound unhappiness, feeling low, down, or sorrowful and are beyond cultural or
  societal norms. Commonly associated with a low self-attitude and grim outlook.
new_value: A negative emotional state characterized by sadness, unhappiness, or sorrow
  that is excessive in intensity, duration, or resistance to self-regulation compared
  with culturally appropriate norms or the individual's usual emotional range. It
  may arise spontaneously or in response to significant life events, but when reactive,
  it is disproportionate to or persists beyond what is typically expected for the
  context. Pathological sadness can be associated with feelings of hopelessness, helplessness,
  anhedonia, and a pessimistic outlook, but these features are not invariably present.
  It may also be accompanied by increased tearfulness, low energy, cognitive difficulties
  such as impaired concentration, and somatic changes including disrupted sleep or
  appetite.

  and ankle region. In clinical practice, OT is a considerable factor that may predispose
  patients to posterior ankle impingement syndrome (PAIS). Lateral ankle x-ray with
  foot in plantarflexion reveals an accessory ossicle at the posterior aspect of the
  talus, between the posterior distal tibia and calcaneal tuberosity.

old_value: Excessive guilt is an internal feeling that is intense and considered clinically
  to be beyond normal range, out of proportion for the act or offense; excessive guilt
  is typically based on an incorrect judgment of responsibility for an unfavorable
  outcome. Excessive guilt is typically pervasive and enduring, i.e. it is not fleeting
  or a temporary thought associated with a specific action.
new_value: The experience of remorse, self-reproach, or perceived culpability for
  a real or perceived unfavorable outcome. Guilt may be proportionate to the context
  or disproportionate, and it may occur in the absence of an identifiable act, event,
  or offense. It reflects the interplay of cognitive processes, such as judgments
  about responsibility, and emotional responses, which can lead to persistent rumination
  or preoccupation. Guilt may extend to situations outside the individual's control
  and, in some cases, be accompanied by inaccurate or exaggerated beliefs about one's
  role in an outcome.

  feel pleasure related to activities that an affected individual previously derived
  pleasure from.
new_value: Decreased ability or inability to experience, feel, or anticipate pleasure
  from activities, experiences, or stimuli that are typically found pleasurable by
  the individual. This may involve diminished enjoyment of previously rewarding experiences
  (e.g., hobbies, social interactions, or sexual activity) or reduced pleasure in
  response to stimuli processed through the senses (e.g., music, food, or tactile
  contact). Anhedonia is a disruption in the capacity to derive emotional reward and
  is not due to primary sensory deficits or medical conditions (e.g., anosmia from
  viral illness). The phenomenon involves altered affective processing rather than
  impaired sensory perception.

new_value: The morphologic classification of MII generally denotes an oocyte that
  is mature, having arrested in metaphase II and is presumed to be capable of fertilization.
  However, there are subsets of women who produce oocytes with MII morphology that
  are not capable of embryo formation even with fertilization. This incongruence between
  morphologic maturity and capacity could be attributed to either the inclusion within
  the morphologic classification immature oocytes arrested at any stage between PBI
  formation and metaphase II, which are not capable of fertilization, or oocytes arrested
  normally at metaphase II that do not possess the ability to complete meiosis.

  that may be in response to an action or statement by others that is perceived to
  be a slight or challenge to the person regardless of the nature. Anger may also
  occur or arise spontaneously in the absence of any provocation and can be directed
  to another person or social entity.
new_value: A state of excessive negative emotional reactivity characterized by strong
  feelings of hostility or antagonism typically in response to perceived provocation.
  It is often accompanied by physiological arousal (e.g., increased heart rate, muscle
  tension, or activation of the sympathetic nervous system) and expressions of blame,
  perceived injustice, or judgment. The experience of anger may be directed outwardly
  toward individuals, groups, objects, or abstract entities, or inwardly toward oneself.

new_value: Iselin's disease is a traction apophysitis of base of fifth metatarsal.
  The apophysis is within the peroneus brevis tendon insertion site and appears radiographically
  at about age 10 in female and age 12 in male and usually fuses by age 11 in female
  and by age 14 in male. Repetitive microtrauma from the peroneus brevis tendon, as
  occurs in sports activities is the cause of traction apophysitis. It can be ascertained
  by oblique foot radiographs showing apophyseal irregularity (enlarged apophysis,
  disordered ossification, widened chondro-osseous junction) at the base of the fifth
  metatarsal.

new_value: A failure of an embryo to progress through the early stages of preimplantation
  development (typically from fertilization, i.e., 1-cell zygote, to blastocyst on
  day 5-6), and is used clinically when embryos fail to reach transferable stages
  in assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) such in vitro fertilization (IVF).
  Arrested embryo development is characterized by downregulation of metabolic activity
  and cessation of cell division. In order for an embryo to be characterized as non-viable,
  i.e., arrested, it should present with a lack of cleaving activity and fail to show
  a sign of mitotic cellular division for at least 24 hours. One can observe failure
  of a zygote to cleave, cleavage stage arrest either on day 2 or day 3 when the embryo
  is expected to be between the 2 and 8-cell stage, failure to compact to morula,
  or failure to form a blastocyst.

old_value: A proneness to anger, i.e., a tendency to become easily bothered or annoyed.
new_value: An emotional state characterized by negative feelings of heightened frustration,
  annoyance, or feeling upset, often triggered by internal factors (e.g., fatigue,
  hunger, unfulfilled desires) or external factors (e.g., social or environmental
  challenges). Irritability may be unpredictable, and is accompanied by a lowered
  threshold for emotional reactivity and observable features (speech, facial expressions,
  or psychomotor activity).

old_value: The inability to feel or express emotions. It is generally recognized by
  the person who often complains that they are unable to feel anything; sadness, joy,
  or contentment are not experienced, rather a sense of nothingness prevails. This
  may be dimensional, ranging from limited ability to experience emotions to the perceived
  complete inability to feel emotions.
new_value: A diminished ability to experience, express, or connect with emotions whether
  positive or negative. This state is often characterized by a pervasive sense of
  emotional disconnection or detachment, where the individual may report feeling \"numb\"
  or lacking emotional responses that were previously present. The reduction in emotional
  response can range from mild dampening of emotional responses to a near-total absence
  of emotional engagement. It is essential to consider the individual's baseline emotional
  capacity, as changes may be more significant in those who previously had a wide
  emotional range.

old_value: An aversive emotional state characterized by negative emotional experiences,
  preoccupations, or internal states that are often related to negative perceptions
  of the self, the world, or the future.
new_value: An emotional state characterized by excessive, persistent, or contextually
  inappropriate negative inner experiences involving emotional arousal and valence.
  These experiences are often associated with negative perceptions of the self, the
  future, the past, or the surrounding environment, and may include affective bias
  such as interpreting neutral or ambiguous stimuli as negative. The intensity, duration,
  or impact of the state exceeds what would be expected for the individual based on
  their baseline emotional functioning, the context, cultural norms, or situational
  triggers, or when it persists despite efforts at self-regulation.
