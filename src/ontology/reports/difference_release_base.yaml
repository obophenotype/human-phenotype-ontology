  The term MODY is now most often used to refer to a group of monogenic diseases with

  at a young age with no or minor insulin dependency, no evidence of insulin resistence,
  and lack of evidence of autoimmune destruction of the beta cells.

old_value: A type of angiokeratoma that typically presents in childhood as a large,
  mostly linear and unilateral hyperkeratotic plaque which is composed of confluent
  keratotic papules. The size ranges from a few centimeters up to a major part of
  the body surface. Initially the lesions present asa multile reddish macules, clinically
  similar to a nevus flammeus. Within several years they develop into acanthokeratotic
  papules that agrregate into plaques which may have a hyperkeratotic surface.

old_value: The cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is an important fetal midline forebrain
  landmark that is normally visible by prenatal sonography. This term refers to the
  lack of visiblity of the CSP on prenatal sonography. The CSP normally can be visualized
  between 18 and 37 weeks of gestation. Lack of visualization of the CSP in this time
  period generally requires follow up and may indicate the presence of underlying
  malformations such as malformations of the corpus callosum. The lack of CSP before
  18 weeks or after 37 weeks of gestation (or postnatally) is considered a normal
  finding.

new_value: The Bell phenomenon is the reflex upward movement of the front of the eyeball
  when the eyelids close (or blink). It protects the eye by helping to keep the cornea
  moist. This term refers to a lack of this phenomenon, which can be observed with
  certain conditions such as congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles.

old_value: A complete duplication affecting one or more of the phalanges of the thumb.
  As opposed to a partial duplication were there is still a variable degree of fusion
  between the duplicated bones, a complete duplication leads to two separate bones
  appearing side to side (radio-ulnar axis) as seen on x-rays. A duplication leading
  to an accesory bone appearing in the proximo-distal axis on x-rays, this is actually
  a different entity called a Pseudoepiphyses (see according terms) sometimes also
  referred to as Hyperphalangism.

  Histopathology shows orthokeratosis or hyperkeratosis, thinning of the suprapapillary
  epithelium, elongation of the rete ridges, hyperpigmentation of the basal layer,
  and follicular cysts. A perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate can be observed
  in the papillary dermis.

old_value: A variety of drugs may occasionally cause transient crystalluria, in isolation
  or in conjunction with other urinary abnormalities. Overdose, dehydration, or hypoalbuminaemia,
  which increases the unbound drug which is ultrafiltrated by the glomerulus, are
  the factors usally favoring the precipitation of crystals within the tubular lumina.
  In some cases, medication-induced crystalluria has a distinct phenotypic appearance.
  For instance, Sulphadiazine crystals appear as strongly birefringent 'shocks of
  wheat' or 'shells' with an amber color. Acyclovir crystals are birefringent and
  needle-shaped, and when present in abundance give to urine a silky and opalescent
  macroscopic appearance.
