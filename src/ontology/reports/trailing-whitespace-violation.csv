Variation from a small notch to complete separation of the helix from the lobe is noted, there may be unilateral or bilateral involvement. The lobe is relatively laterally recessed compared to the upper portion of the ear and the scapha may be absent. This is distinct from a Cleft helix where the cleft is within the helix. "

Most anal canal adenocarcinomas originate from anal glands, but cases developing in chronic tracts from fistula in ano are described. Multiple factors, including infection with HPV and HIV, history of receptive anal intercourse, smoking, and immunosuppression have been identified as risk factors. Clinical features include anal pain, induration of the anal canal, or abscess formation and a palpable lump. "

They may be difficult to distinguish from striated muscle hamartomas or tragal duplications. Pretragal ectopias often appear helix-like, and in such cases may be called Polyotia. "
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0008330,http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment,"Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a key hemostatic protein, but documenting its function through laboratory tests is not always straightforward. VWF serves as a carrier protein for factor VIII (FVIII), and also facilitates platelet adhesion through its interaction with platelet GPIb on the platelet surface and through its binding to the subendothelial matrix. This interaction is driven in vivo by shear stress, which induces a conformational change in VWF that allows it to bind platelet GPIb. In vitro, however, this interaction is induced by the antibiotic ristocetin, which enables VWF and platelet GPIb to interact in the absence of shear forces. Laboratory testing of VWF utilizes ristocetin in the VWF ristocetin cofactor activity assay (VWF:RCo), which is a measure of VWF binding to platelets, or by ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA).

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0000533,http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment,"Choroidal sclerosis is a descriptive term applied to the ophthalmoscopic appearance of prominent white choroidal vessels in which the blood columns are not seen or are sheathed by white lines. Choroidal sclerosis is a term used to describe a group of genetically heterogeneous retinal dystrophies that share a common funduscopic phenotype of scalloped, well-circumscribed, and confluent chorioretinal atrophic lesions that extend beyond the macula. The term choroidal sclerosis was initially coined because of the sclerotic appearance of choroidal vessels which frequently appear white or light-yellow. However, histologic studies have demonstrated the term to be a misnomer as the principle abnormality is the loss of choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the outer retina in the absence of abnormal sclerotic changes in the choroidal vasculature. Therefore, we are making choroidal sclerosis a synonym of chorioretinal atrophy. "

Gallbladder perforation is a rare but life-threatening complication of acute cholecystitis, with a reported mortality rate of 12 to 42 percent. The bile leak from a ruptured gallbladder might be contained in the extra peritoneal gallbladder fossa, and hence might not produce symptoms of peritonitis immediately. "

This term is only used if the finger has the normal number of phalangeal segments. An appropriate alternative term for the first digit is Small thumb, when it is the only digit affected. When a thumb and one or more fingers are affected, it may be more economical to specify Small fingers, F1-5 instead of separately specifying Small thumb and Small fingers F2-5. "

Both sexes are affected equally. Patients present with signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus. Focal neurological signs may be present in older children. On MRI, ependymoblastomas are large heterogeneously enhancing lesion with associated brain edema and mass effect. Ependymoblastomas are well-circumscribed lesions, with a distinct margin between tumor and normal brain, though focal microscopic extension and leptomeningeal invasion are common. Histologically, an ependymoblastoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumor with tumor cell arranged in multilayered rosettes consisting of an outer rim of tumor cells merging with the surrounding undifferentiated neuroectodermal cells. The tumor cells are immunopositive for S100, vimentin, cytokeratin and GFAP, and show high mitotic activity. "
