<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030666>	"Retinal neovascularization"	"In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina. Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to as traction retinal detachment."

The term choroidal sclerosis was initially coined because of the sclerotic appearance of choroidal vessels which frequently appear white or light-yellow. However, histologic studies have demonstrated the term to be a misnomer as the principle abnormality is the loss of choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the outer retina in the absence of abnormal sclerotic changes in the choroidal vasculature.
