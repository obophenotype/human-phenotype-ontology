description: "Decreased or reduced functionality of a molecular function, which is a process that can be carried out by the action of a single macromolecular machine, usually via direct physical interactions with other molecular entities, such as binding, catalysis, enzyme activities (like hydrolases, ligases), etc. Example: HP_0002932 'Aldehyde oxidase deficiency'"
