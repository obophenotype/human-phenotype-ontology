comment: Example: [E=organism Q=lacks_all_parts_of_type E2=Wing] - applies to an organism. A relational quality in which the bearer entity has no parts of the specified type. The bearer of this quality has_part = 0 of the indicated entity type, where a comparable organism usually has at least 1 part of the same type. Note that the bearer of the quality is the whole, not the part. Formally: If a bearer entity e lacks all parts of type X at time t, then there exists no instances x of X at t such that x part_of e that has no wings, where wings are normally present in that organism type. In OWL this is equivalent to a restriction on the OBO_REL:has_part relation with cardinality=0, i.e has_part 0 E2.

comment: We use the has_part relation to relate complex qualities to more primitive ones. A complex quality is a collection of qualities. The complex quality cannot exist without the sub-qualities. For example, the quality 'swollen' necessarily comes with the qualities of 'protruding' and 'increased size'.

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.
